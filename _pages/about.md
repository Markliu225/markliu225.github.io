I am a Master by Research student in Computer Science and Engineering at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, where I work with Yonggang Wen on sustainable computing and resilient communication systems. My current projects emphasize energy-aware infrastructure for large-scale data centers, including compute-power-thermal co-optimization, and the design of reliable network architectures that balance performance with environmental impact.
